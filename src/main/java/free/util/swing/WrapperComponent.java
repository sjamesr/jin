/**
 * A base class for components which wrap some UI and present a convenient API for it. This class is
 * a convenience base class for such implementations. It provides the following features:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The default layout manager is {@link WrapLayout}.
 *   <li>It supports change listeners. The subclass is responsible only for invoking
 *       fireStateChanged() when its state actually changed. Note that the <code>
 *       addChangeListener/removeChangeListener</code> methods are <code>protected</code> by default
 *       - it's up to the subclass to allow access to them, by overriding them with a <code>public
 *       </code> modifier.
 *   <li>Invoking <code>setEnabled()</code> on the component will set the enabled state of all its
 *       children, recursively.
 * </ul>
